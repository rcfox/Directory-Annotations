This is the project for the directory annotate that you are currently reading.
Use annotate.pl to write a message such as thing one.
Use ls.pl as a replacement for the standard ls in order to automatically see the directory annotations.

I recommend setting an alias: alias ls="<dir>/ls.pl --color=auto"
